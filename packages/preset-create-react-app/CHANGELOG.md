- Remove `react-docgen-typescript-loader` from the preset [#103](https://github.com/storybookjs/presets/pull/103)

Starting in `v5.x`, `react-docgen` supports typescript natively, so we no longer recommend `react-docgen-typescript-loader` and have removed it from the preset. This is a breaking change and the migration is documented in [Storybook](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/blob/next/MIGRATION.md#react-prop-tables-with-typescript).
